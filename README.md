# &nbsp;- ALL ABOUT GIT - ‚úî

This "All-about-GIT"-repository catches up its focus on all the USEFUL GIT COMMANDS I did during my projects through the years as a **SAE-Web Development** student with exercise lessons every week as well as tutorial videos on _Youtube_.

üëçGOOD TO KNOW:ü§ó

=> `GIT` is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects.

=> `Terminal` is an electronic hardware device that can be used for entering data (transcribing data) from a computer or a computing system.

=> `GITHUB` is a network-based version management service for software development projects. It was named after the version management system Git.

|8| $ git merge test | CAREFUL: Only works if you are in the source branch (like "master") and "drag in" the changes.  |
